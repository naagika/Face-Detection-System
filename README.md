# Face Recognition System

## Description

This project implements a face recognition system using Haar Cascade for face detection and embeddings for face recognition. The system captures live video from a camera, detects faces in real-time, and recognizes the faces using embeddings stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Detection:** Uses Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces in real-time from live video feed.
- **Face Recognition:** Utilizes embeddings generated by the `imgbeddings` library to recognize faces by comparing them with stored embeddings in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built with `tkinter` to provide an interactive interface for users to capture, detect, and recognize faces.
- **Loading Indicator:** Displays an animated loading indicator during face detection and recognition processes.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language for the project.
- **OpenCV:** For image and video processing, specifically for face detection using Haar Cascade classifiers.
- **imgbeddings:** To generate embeddings for face recognition.
- **Pillow (PIL):** For image processing tasks.
- **psycopg2:** To interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- **tkinter:** For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the main script:**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Interact with the GUI:**
   - **Detect Faces:** Click the "Detect Faces" button to start the face detection process.
   - **View Results:** Recognized faces will be displayed on the interface with their names.
